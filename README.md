# tictactoe

This is a Harry Potter inspired tictactoe game. 
The rules are the same, get three of your selected symbols in a row and you win. easy right? 
You will either be house Gryffindor "X" or house Slytherin "O".
May the best wizard win!
Also, watch out for gnargles, I hear they are troublesome creatures.
